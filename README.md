# Password Strength Analyzer with Custom Wordlist Generator

## Description
This project analyzes password strength using the zxcvbn library and generates customized wordlists based on user-provided personal information. It demonstrates real-world password vulnerabilities for educational and ethical hacking purposes.

## Features
- Password strength analysis (score, crack time, suggestions)
- User-input-based password evaluation
- Custom wordlist generation
- Leetspeak and numeric pattern mutations
- Wordlist export in `.txt` format
